# CareerFoundry-Instacart-Python-Project
This repository contains my Python code for a student project I completed while studying at CareerFoundry. 

# Project Context:
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they affect the sale of their products.

# Key Question and Objectives:
Stakeholders would like data-driven answers to the following questions to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products:

● The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.

● They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.

● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.

● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.

● What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?

● Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?

● Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?

● Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?

● What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?

● What differences can you find in the ordering habits of different customer profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.

# Data and Tools Used
"The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017", accessed from www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017 via Kaggle on <24/04/2024>.

By the end of the project, 4 original data sets had been cleaned and merged to form a comprehensive data set containing over 30 million rows and 37 rows
