# Python - Instacart Analysis Project
This repository contains my Python code for a student project I completed while studying at CareerFoundry. This project culminated in the creation of an Excel report, documenting processes of data cleaning, data wrangling, and column derivations. The report also contains a Population Flow, visualisations from the data, and recommendations based on the business questions posed in the project brief.

## Project Context:
![image](https://github.com/Kyle-Stanford1612/Python-InstacartAnalysis-Project/assets/171201472/b5526b57-324f-45e6-9e8b-830faef67344)


Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they affect the sale of their products.

## Key Question and Objectives:
Stakeholders would like to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products. These are some of the business questions asked to that end:

● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.

● What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?

● Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?

● Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?

● Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?

## Data and Tools Used
5 datasets were used throughout the project:

● Orders

● Orders_products_prior

● Products

● Customers

● Departments

These datasets were analysed using Python in Jupyter Notebook. The following libraries were used:

Numpy | Pandas | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Scipy

## Folders
Project files are stored using the following folder structure:

● *01 Project Management*: Contains project brief.

● *02 Data*: Data files have not been uploaded to GitHub due to the folder size. The following subfolders were used:

  → Original Data contains the original data frames. 
  
  → Prepared Data contains data frames that have been edited using Python (cleaning, merging, etc.)

● *03 Scripts*: Contains Jupyter notebooks with all relevant code used throughout the project.

● *04 Analysis*: Contains all visualisations made throughout the project which led to insights.

● *05 Sent to Client*: Contains the final Excel report.

### Note:
Instacart is a real company that’s made their data available online. However, the contents of the attached project brief
have been fabricated by CareerFoundry for this project.
