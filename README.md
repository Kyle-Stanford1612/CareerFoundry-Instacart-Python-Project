# CareerFoundry-Instacart-Python-Project
This repository contains my Python code for a student project I completed while studying at CareerFoundry. 
In this project, I used Python to clean large data sets, merge data sets, run descriptive analyses, create columns, and visualise the data to answer business questions for an online grocery business Instacart.

# Project Context and Objective:
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app.
As a business analyst, my job was to perform an exploratory analysis of some of Instacart's data to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

# Data:
"The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017", accessed from www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017 via Kaggle on <24/04/2024>.

By the end of the project, 4 original data sets had been cleaned and merged to form a comprehensive data set containing over 30 million rows and 37 rows

# Skills Learned:
Data wrangling and subsetting

Data consistency checks

Combining and Exporting Data

Deriving new variables using loc(), if-statements, and for-loops

Grouping and Aggregating Data

Data Visualisation using Matplotlib, seaborn, and Scipy
